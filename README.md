# Circular Reveal

_A demo of recyclerview fragment circular reveal that respects the position of item clicked_

This app illustrates circular reveal for a fragment when a recyclerview item is clicked. The enter animation starts at the location where the item is clicked. Going back, the exit animation also closes at where the item was clicked.
